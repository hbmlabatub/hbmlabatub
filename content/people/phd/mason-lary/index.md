Hi there! I'm Mason, a student with HBML focused on the movements of sign language. My secondary
focuses are in compositional models of motion using Category Theory.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring small towns around me, kayaking, and hiking. You'll often find
me lost in thought walking around campus.
